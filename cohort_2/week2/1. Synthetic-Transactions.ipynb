    "# Week 2: Fine-tuning Embeddings for RAG Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Prerequisites**: Please complete Week 1's notebooks before starting this one. The concepts build directly on that foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most teams avoid fine-tuning their embedding models, thinking they need tons of data and complex setups. But our experience shows that with just 100-200 thoughtfully created examples, you can significantly improve your model's performance over general-purpose embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning embedding models gives several key advantages over using general-purpose models. While it takes more upfront work to create training data and run the fine-tuning process, this investment typically leads to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Much better accuracy on your specific tasks\n",
    "2. Lower running costs through using smaller, more efficient models\n",
    "3. Better handling of domain-specific language and context\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this tutorial, you'll discover how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build Quality Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate synthetic transactions systematically\n",
    "- Review and validate examples manually\n",
    "- Create diverse, representative samples\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Structure Your Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define clear schema for transactions\n",
    "- Add meaningful metadata\n",
    "- Ensure data consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Establish Performance Baselines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Measure initial embedding performance\n",
    "- Calculate retrieval metrics\n",
    "- Set up evaluation pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll know how to create high-quality synthetic data for fine-tuning embedding models. This prepares you for the hands-on fine-tuning work in notebooks 2 and 3, where we'll use both Cohere's managed service and open-source tools to improve retrieval performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case Study: Ramp's Transaction Categorization\n",
    "\n",
    "> Read about Ramp's succesful case study using fine-tuned embeddings [here](https://engineering.ramp.com/transaction-embeddings)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll follow Ramp's successful approach to fine-tuning embeddings for transaction categorization. Their team demonstrated that even with unique customer categories, a fine-tuned model could effectively generalize to new customers and scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using synthetic financial data, we'll walk through their process step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Understanding**: Learn what transaction data looks like and how to structure it for embedding\n",
    "2. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create realistic, challenging test cases using large language models\n",
    "3. **Model Fine-tuning**: Compare performance between base and fine-tuned models\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this process, we'll use Braintrust to track experiments and measure improvements systematically. This workflow will give you a practical foundation for fine-tuning embeddings in your own applications.\n"

    "### Understanding Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "To fine-tune our model effectively, we need to understand the transaction data we're working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical Transaction Fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Merchant Name: The vendor or service provider's name.\n",
    "- Merchant Category Code (MCC): General category of the transaction (e.g., Restaurants).\n",
    "- Department Name: The company department responsible for the transaction.\n",
    "- Location: Where the transaction took place.\n",
    "- Amount: The transaction's monetary value.\n",
    "- Spend Program Name: Specific budget or spend limit allocated.\n",
    "- Trip Name: If the transaction occurred during travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see an example below\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Name : Beirut Bakery\n",
    "Category: Restaurants, Cafeteria\n",
    "Department: Engineering\n",
    "Location: Calgary, AB, Canada\n",
    "Amount: 56.67 CAD\n",
    "Card: Ramp's Physical Card\n",
    "Trip Name: unknown\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a difficult task because there's very little information. Additionally since each company has unique categories that have some implicit rules, it's difficult for a general embedding model to classify these transactions without fine-tuning.\n"

    "## Generating Synthetic Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll generate a synthetic transaction dataset in 3 steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Examples** : We'll create a batch of basic transactions using `gpt-4o-mini` and manually review them to create a small dataset of good and bad examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Refine Data** : We'll then randomly select a subset of these initial examples and use them to generate new examples that are more challenging by adding them to the prompt as few shot examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Braintrust Evaluation** : We'll then use `braintrust` to evaluate the recall@1,3,5 and mrr@1,3,5 of our initial and refined examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using `ChatGPT` to evaluate these examples and get a sense for what makes a good or bad example during this process. We'll iterate on this until we've generated at least 300 examples. This will ensure that we have enough examples to fine-tune a cohere re-ranker ( requires min 256 examples) or a sentence transformer model while also having enough examples to create a held out evaluation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two key advantages to iteratively generating our dataset in small batches\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Practicality** : A small amount of data is easy to label\n",
    "2. **Randomness** : By constantly sampling from our growing number of examples, we're able to have enough randomness to create a diverse dataset. This helps us to avoid potential issues with diversity and quality that doing a single pass of data generation can introduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1 : Generating our initial transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by generating our initial transactions using a simple prompt. These are going to be very simple examples that will not be great but they are useful as an initial starting point.\n"

This allows us to easily run evaluations on our model in the subsequent notebooks later on.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've laid the foundation for fine-tuning by creating high-quality synthetic training data. Our analysis shows that our train and eval sets have similar performance metrics, suggesting they represent the same underlying patterns and will give us reliable estimates of real-world performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our approach works well for getting started, production systems need more robust testing - like generating similar but different labels, using multiple test sets, and carefully preventing data leakage. We'll explore some of these ideas in Week 4 when we look at handling different types of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next two notebooks, we'll put this data to work: first using Cohere's managed re-ranker service as an easy starting point, then exploring open-source fine-tuning for more control. This builds on Week 1's evaluation framework while preparing us for more advanced query handling in future weeks.\n"
