    "# Week 2: Getting Started with Re-ranker Fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Prerequisites**: Complete the `1. Synthetic Transactions.ipynb` notebook first to generate the evaluation dataset we'll use for fine-tuning. You'll also need a Cohere API Key which you can get by signing up for a free account on [Cohere](https://cohere.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "When improving RAG systems, starting with a managed re-ranker service can provide quick wins with minimal engineering overhead. This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune a Cohere re-ranker for better retrieval performance using just a few hundred examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-rankers offer several advantages when you're just getting started:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Efficiency**\n",
    "   - Work effectively with limited data (as few as 256 examples)\n",
    "   - Only need to learn ranking within small candidate sets  \n",
    "   - Can achieve significant gains without massive training sets\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Easy Integration** \n",
    "   - Drop-in addition to existing retrieval pipelines\n",
    "   - Progressive improvement without system overhauls\n",
    "   - No need to re-embed your entire document collection\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quick Implementation**\n",
    "   - Hosted services handle infrastructure complexity\n",
    "   - No hyperparameter tuning required  \n",
    "   - Focus on experimentation rather than deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Through hands-on examples, you'll discover how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare Training Data**\n",
    "   - Format data for re-ranker fine-tuning\n",
    "   - Create effective training examples\n",
    "   - Generate hard negatives\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fine-tune Models**\n",
    "   - Configure training parameters\n",
    "   - Monitor training progress\n",
    "   - Validate model improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate Performance**\n",
    "   - Compare against baseline retrieval\n",
    "   - Measure recall and MRR improvements\n",
    "   - Analyze result quality\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a fine-tuned re-ranker improving your retrieval results. This builds on Week 1's evaluation framework while preparing you for more advanced fine-tuning using open-source models in notebook 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing Our Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll be using the synthetic transactions dataset we created in the previous notebook to fine-tune a Cohere re-ranker. We'll be using the `rerank-english-v3.0` model as our base model and creating a dataset with hard negatives so that oure-reanker learns the difference between similar categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hard Negatives\n",
    "\n",
    "A key aspect of effective re-ranker training is the selection of hard negatives - examples that are similar to the correct answer but shouldn't be ranked highly. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Query:\n",
    "```\n",

    "Hard negatives help your model by:\n",
    "1. Improving discriminative ability between similar categories\n",
    "2. Building robustness against noisy results\n",
    "3. Making efficient use of limited training data\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrated how fine-tuning a Cohere re-ranker can significantly improve retrieval performance. With just 256 synthetic examples, our fine-tuned model showed a 60% increase in recall and a 49% increase in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) compared to the text-embedding-3-small model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This substantial improvement highlights two key considerations for future fine-tuning efforts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Selection**: Explore various re-ranker options, including English and multi-lingual models from providers like Cohere and Jina. Experiment to find the best fit for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dataset Quality**: Move beyond simple random negative selection. Consider more sophisticated approaches like using cosine similarity or leveraging language models to identify hard negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fast, objective metrics we established in Week 1 were crucial in our analysis. They allowed us to quickly benchmark our fine-tuned model against both the default Cohere re-ranker and the text-embedding-3-small model. Surprisingly, we discovered that the default Cohere re-ranker actually degraded performance while increasing latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Week 4, we'll use similar approaches to discover query patterns with BERTopic, and in Week 5, we'll apply these techniques to structured data and metadata. These are applications where a fine-tuned re-ranker can provide a significant improvement for, especially when at the start when we have a limited amount of user data.As you accumulate more user data, that's when you might want to start looking at fine-tuning an open-source model using the Sentence Transformers library which introduces new challenges such as managing hyper-parameters, loss functions and training loops which we'll explore in the next notebook."
