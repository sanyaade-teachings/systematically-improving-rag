    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning open source models gives you full control over how your model learns and behaves. While we'll use a small synthetic dataset of 256 examples for this tutorial, real-world applications benefit greatly from larger private datasets - the larger the better. This is because larger datasets allow you to capture specific domain knowledge and relationships that general models might miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of open source fine-tuning is the cost savings at inference time. Once trained, you can run these models on your own infrastructure without paying per-query fees. This makes them especially attractive for high-volume applications. We'll use sentence-transformers since it offers robust training options, works seamlessly with popular model hubs, and has strong community support.\n",

    "1. **Dataset Preparation**\n",
    "   - Creating train/test/eval splits\n",
    "   - Formatting data for triplet loss\n",
    "   - Setting up evaluation metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Fine-tuning**\n",
    "   - Configuring training arguments\n",
    "   - Setting up loss functions\n",
    "   - Training and monitoring progress\n",

    "   - Analyzing trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a better understanding of when you might want to consider fine-tuning an open source embedding model, how you can do so using the `sentence-transformers` library and how to evaluate the performance of your fine-tuned model.\n"

    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll be fine-tuning the `BAAI/bge-base-en` model. We'll be using the `BatchSemiHardTripletLoss` loss function to train our model. Let's first understand how this loss function works before we dive into the code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Semi-Hard Triplet Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Batch Semi Hard Triplet Loss works by taking a batch of sentence pairs and computing the loss for all possible valid triplets, then identifying semi-hard positives and negatives. A semi-hard negative is an example that is not as close to the anchor as the positive example, but is still close to the anchor than the negative example. \n",
    "It works with three pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An anchor (your main example) - in our case, a transaction description\n",
    "2. A positive match (something similar) - the correct category\n",
    "3. A negative match (something different) - incorrect categories that are close, but not quite right\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see an example of this in the image below where we have an achor, a positive match and a negative match. The negative match is not as close to the anchor as the positive match, but is still close to the anchor than the negative match.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./data/hard_negatives.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"Semi-hard negative mining illustration\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For our transaction data, this translates to:\n",
    "- Anchor: Transaction description\n",
    "- Positive: Correct category\n",
    "- Negative: Similar but incorrect categories\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important here to note that the reason why we want an example that's **semi-hard** is because we want to find negative examples that are tricky. They need to be different as compared to the anchor, but not too different. This ultimately helps the model learn to distinguish between similar and dissimilar examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"./data/semi-hard-negative.png\" width = 500 />\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our Cohere dataset format:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The transaction description becomes our anchor (query)\n",
    "2. The correct category is our positive match (relevant_passages)\n",
    "3. Similar but wrong categories are our negative matches (hard_negatives)\n",
    "\n",
    "While a single training run can provide a baseline, exploring hyperparameter optimization—through techniques like grid or random search—can significantly enhance model performance, especially when executed on a larger scale with appropriate computational resources. Here's a quick example of [how we can do this using `modal` to run a grid search over all possible parameters](https://modal.com/blog/fine-tuning-embeddings)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaring Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing fine-tuning code, we want to declare our constants up front. This ensures that we have a consistent set of parameters to use when training our model and makes it easy for us to change them later."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we successfully fine-tuned the BAAI/bge-base-en model using sentence-transformers, achieving a 20% improvement in MRR@1 and a 12% increase in recall@5 compared to the base model. More importantly, we learned how to balance performance gains against implementation complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes our exploration of fine-tuning approaches, where we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Created synthetic training data thoughtfully using iterative generation and manual review to ensure quality\n",
    "2. Explored managed re-rankers through Cohere, showing how they offer quick wins with minimal setup\n",
    "3. Implemented open-source fine-tuning using sentence-transformers, trading simplicity for greater control and lower inference costs\n",
    "\n",
    "While managed solutions like Cohere offer faster time-to-production and simplified deployment, open-source models provide greater control and customization potential. The choice between these approaches should be guided by your specific requirements, resources, and the level of performance improvement needed for your use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "These retrieval improvements complement the techniques we'll explore in later weeks - like discovering query patterns (Week 4) and handling structured data (Week 5). By combining effective retrieval with these methods, we can build more robust and capable RAG systems."
