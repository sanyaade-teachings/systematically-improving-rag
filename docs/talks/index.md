## All Talks

### Core RAG Concepts

#### [RAG Anti-patterns in the Wild](rag-antipatterns-skylar-payne.md)

Skylar Payne shares extensive experience identifying common RAG anti-patterns across different industries. This talk provides practical advice for improving AI systems through better data handling, retrieval, and evaluation practices, highlighting the most frequent mistakes teams make and concrete strategies to avoid them.

#### [Agentic RAG](colin-rag-agents.md)

Colin Flaherty (previously a founding engineer at Augment and co-author of Meta's Cicero AI) discusses autonomous coding agents and retrieval systems. This session explores how agentic approaches are transforming traditional RAG systems, revealing when simple tools like grep outperform sophisticated embedding models, and how agent persistence can overcome retrieval limitations.

### Search and Retrieval

#### [Fine-tuning Re-rankers and Embedding Models for Better RAG Performance](fine-tuning-rerankers-embeddings-ayush-lancedb.md)

Ayush from LanceDB presents comprehensive insights on improving retrieval performance through fine-tuning. This session covers practical approaches to training re-rankers, fine-tuning embedding models, and understanding the trade-offs between performance improvements and system complexity. Learn about the business impact of fine-tuning, when to use different architectures like ColBERT vs cross-encoders, and how to combine multiple optimization techniques for maximum retrieval effectiveness.

#### [Semantic Search Over the Web with Exa](semantic-search-exa-will-bryk.md)

Will Bryk from Exa shares how AI is fundamentally changing search requirements. This talk covers the technical challenges of building a semantic search engine designed specifically for AI applications rather than human users, offering unique insights into the evolution of search technology.

#### [Lexical Search in RAG Applications](john-lexical-search.md)

John Berryman shares expertise on traditional search techniques and their application in RAG systems. This session explores how lexical search can complement modern vector-based approaches, covering inverted indexes, TF-IDF scoring, and hybrid search strategies.

#### [Enterprise Search and Fine-tuning Embedding Models](glean-manav.md)

Manav from Glean delivers an insightful lecture on enterprise search and fine-tuning embedding models. This session focuses on Glean's approach to optimizing AI through custom embedding models, handling company-specific language, and learning from user feedback.

#### [Encoder Stacking and Multi-Modal Retrieval](superlinked-encoder-stacking.md)

Daniel from Superlinked explores improving retrieval systems by applying lessons from recommender systems. This talk reveals insights about the limitations of current search approaches and how to build sophisticated retrieval architectures that handle diverse data types using specialized encoders.

### Data Organization and Processing

#### [Query Routing for RAG Systems](query-routing-anton.md)

Anton Troynikov from ChromaDB shares critical insights about organizing data for retrieval systems. This session covers data organization strategies, the limitations of the "big pile of records" approach, and effective query routing techniques.
