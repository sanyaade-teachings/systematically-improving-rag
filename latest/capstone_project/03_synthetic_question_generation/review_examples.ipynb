    "# Synthetic Question Generation: The Power of Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Notebook Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "When building RAG systems, one of the biggest challenges is generating good synthetic questions for evaluation and training. Most people focus on getting better models or more data, but **the most critical factor is actually your prompt design**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll compare two different approaches to synthetic question generation and show you how dramatically different results can be based on your prompt strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **How prompt design shapes everything** - Small changes in prompts lead to completely different outputs\n",
    "2. **The importance of understanding user intent** - What kinds of questions will your users actually ask?\n",
    "3. **How to choose the right approach** - Different prompts for different use cases\n",
    "4. **Practical guidance** - How to design prompts for your specific domain\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use real conversations from the WildChat dataset and generate synthetic queries using two different approaches:\n",
    "- **V1**: Search-focused (helping users find information)\n",
    "- **V2**: Pattern-focused (finding similar conversations)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay close attention to how different the results are - this will help you understand why prompt engineering is so critical for your RAG system's success.\n"
