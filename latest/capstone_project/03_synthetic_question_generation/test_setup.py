However, in the presence of oxygen and moisture, further oxidation occurs: Cu+ ‚Üí Cu2+ + e-, leading to cupric compounds. Formic acid (HCOOH) significantly accelerates corrosion by: 1) Lowering pH, making the environment more corrosive, 2) Acting as a complexing agent for copper ions, and 3) Breaking down the protective oxide layer. The acid forms copper formate complexes, which are more soluble than oxide layers, thus removing the protective barrier and exposing fresh copper to further attack."
