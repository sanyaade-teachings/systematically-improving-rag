# Notes 

One of the goals I have right now is to do some of the processes I would undergo when building out back applications. The first thing really is to understand the data source that I'm working with. In this example, the text chunk I'm working with is the first message in Wildtrap. And in particular, this idea that I can use conversations because everyone at some point will be analyzing conversation data.
