    "# Building Production Query Classifiers for RAG Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Series Overview**: This is the final notebook in our three-part series on systematically analyzing and improving RAG systems. We've discovered patterns and improved clustering—now we'll build production-ready classifiers to act on these insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Prerequisites**: Complete both \"1. Cluster Conversations\" and \"2. Better Summaries\" notebooks first. You'll need `instructor` and `instructor_classify` libraries installed, plus the labeled dataset from our clustering analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discovery without action is just interesting data.** In our previous notebooks, we systematically analyzed 560 user queries and uncovered clear patterns through improved clustering. We know that three major themes—experiment management, artifact handling, and deployment—account for the majority of user questions. But knowing patterns exist in historical data isn't enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To transform insights into improvements, we need real-time classification.** Specifically, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detect Production Drift** - Identify when certain query types suddenly increase, signaling emerging issues\n",
    "2. **Route Queries Intelligently** - Direct questions to specialized retrieval pipelines based on their category\n",
    "3. **Prioritize Improvements** - Focus engineering resources on high-volume, low-satisfaction query types\n",
    "4. **Measure Impact** - Track how changes affect different user segments over time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification bridges the gap between discovery and action**, transforming our topic modeling insights into a production-ready system for continuous RAG improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final notebook, you'll discover how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Production-Ready Classifiers**\n",
    "   - Build efficient classifiers using the `instructor-classify` framework\n",
    "   - Generate weak labels automatically for rapid dataset creation\n",
    "   - Design systematic workflows for human label verification\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Achieve High Classification Accuracy**\n",
    "   - Start with baseline performance and iterate systematically\n",
    "   - Apply advanced prompting techniques (system prompts, few-shot examples)\n",
    "   - Measure and visualize improvements using confusion matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scale Classification to Full Datasets**\n",
    "   - Apply optimized classifiers to thousands of queries efficiently\n",
    "   - Understand true query distributions across your user base\n",
    "   - Identify high-impact areas for targeted RAG improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Achieve\n",
    "\n",
    "**By the end of this notebook, you'll have built a classifier that achieves 90.9% accuracy**—improving from a 72.7% baseline through systematic prompt engineering. You'll discover that just three categories (artifacts, integrations, visualizations) account for 50% of all user conversations, giving you clear targets for maximum impact improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**More importantly, you'll have a complete methodology for continuous RAG improvement**: discover patterns through clustering → validate with better summaries → monitor continuously through classification → prioritize improvements based on real usage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From Reactive to Proactive RAG Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most RAG systems improve reactively**—waiting for user complaints or noticing obvious failures. **This series shows you how to build proactively improving systems** that identify problems before users complain and prioritize fixes based on systematic analysis rather than the loudest feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have moved from \"we think users struggle with X\" to \"we know 20% of users need help with artifacts, 15% with integrations, and 14% with visualizations—and we can automatically detect and route these queries for specialized handling.\""

    "   - Create an initial classifier using the instructor-classify framework\n",
    "   - Generate preliminary labels for your conversation dataset\n",
    "   - Use app.py to review and correct weak labels for a high-quality labeled dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iteratively Improve Classification Accuracy**\n",
    "   - Start with a simple baseline classifier\n",

    "   - Measure improvements using confusion matrices and accuracy metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analyze Query Distribution in Your Dataset**\n",
    "   - Apply your optimized classifier to the full dataset\n",
    "   - Understand the prevalence of different query types\n",
    "   - Identify high-impact areas for RAG system improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than trying to replicate all the nuanced clusters from our topic modeling, we'll focus on three high-impact categories that emerged from our analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Artifacts - Questions about creating, versioning, and managing W&B artifacts\n",
    "2. Integrations - Questions about integrating W&B with specific libraries and frameworks\n",
    "3. Visualisations - Questions about creating charts, dashboards, and visual analysis\n",
    "4. Other - General queries that don't fit the specialized categories above\n",

    "### Creating Weak Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a weak label? A weak label is an automatically generated label that might be incorrect, but is \"good enough\" to start with. Think of it like a rough first draft - it gives you a starting point that you can then review and correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world RAG systems, manually labeling thousands of queries is prohibitively time-consuming. Instead of having humans label every single query from scratch, weak labeling lets us use an AI classifier to do the initial work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our classifier automatically assigns labels to hundreds of queries in minutes\n",
    "2. We review these \"weak labels\" and ask annotators to simply accept/reject the labels\n",
    "3. This allows us to create gold label datasets much faster and efficiently that we would be able to do so manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has several key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Speed: We can process hundreds or thousands of examples in minutes rather than hours\n",
    "2. Consistency: The classifier applies the same criteria across all examples\n",
    "3. Scalability: The process can be applied to continuously growing datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "The process follows a virtuous cycle: our classifier generates weak labels → humans verify a subset → verified labels improve the classifier → better classifier generates more accurate weak labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help you try this, we've created a simple UI using streamlit where we can then either approve or reject these labels. You can run this at `streamlit run app.py`."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final notebook, you learned how to bridge the gap between discovery and production by building robust query classifiers. You discovered how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generate weak labels efficiently** using automated classification and human review workflows\n",
    "- **Build production classifiers** using the `instructor` library with systematic prompt engineering\n",
    "- **Iteratively improve performance** through enhanced system prompts and few-shot examples\n",
    "- **Evaluate and measure accuracy** using confusion matrices and validation/test splits\n",
    "- **Apply classifiers at scale** to understand true query distributions across your dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "We built a production-ready classifier that achieved 90.9% accuracy through systematic prompt engineering, starting from a 72.7% baseline. Our iterative improvements—adding clear system prompts (+10.7%) and strategic few-shot examples (+25% total)—demonstrated the power of thoughtful prompt design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying our classifier to the full dataset revealed that just three categories—artifacts (20%), integrations (15%), and visualizations (14%)—account for roughly 50% of all user conversations. This concentration is significant because it means we can focus improvement efforts on these specific areas to impact half of all user interactions with measurable precision:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Artifacts**: Analyze specific operations users struggle with (versioning, linking, metadata management) to build specialized guides and automated workflows\n",
    "- **Integrations**: Identify which libraries generate the most questions to create framework-specific tutorials and testing tools  \n",
    "- **Visualizations**: Understand common visualization needs to build specialized UIs and simpler workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, this systematic approach transforms vague user feedback into actionable product insights, enabling engineering teams to prioritize features, documentation teams to focus efforts, and product teams to make data-driven roadmap decisions.\n",

    "With our classifier successfully identifying query patterns at 90%+ accuracy, you've built the foundation for advanced RAG improvements that extend far beyond this tutorial series:\n",

    "- **Specialized Retrieval Pipelines**: Build dedicated embedding models and retrieval strategies optimized for each category\n",
    "- **Proactive Monitoring**: Detect when artifact queries surge, signaling potential documentation gaps or product issues\n",
    "- **Intelligent Query Routing**: Automatically direct integration questions to framework-specific knowledge bases or expert systems\n",
    "- **Closed-loop Feedback**: Measure which query types have the lowest satisfaction scores to prioritize improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight from this entire series is that improving RAG systems isn't about better models or more data—it's about understanding your users systematically and building focused solutions for their actual needs. This methodology can be applied to any domain where you have query-document pairs and want to move from reactive fixes to proactive, data-driven improvements."
