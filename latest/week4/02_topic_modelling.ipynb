    "# Week 4 - Systematically Improving Your Rag Application\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Prerequisites**: Please make sure that you've ran `1. Generate Dataset.ipynb` to generate the dataset that we'll be using in this notebook. It'll also help you to get familiar with data that we're working with for this specific case study\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll look at how we can use topic modelling to identify clusters of related queries that we can then manually inspect. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "When handling thousands of daily user queries, manually reviewing each conversation isn't practical. Instead of guessing what users are asking about, topic modeling helps us automatically group similar questions together. \n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these patterns and combining them with data like query volume and user satisfaction, we can prioritize improvements where they matter most. This is especially true when we have domain experts who can help us validate our topics and come up with explicit categories for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this hands-on analysis of synthetic Klarna support queries, you'll discover how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set Up Topic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configure BERTopic for query analysis\n",
    "- Choose appropriate clustering parameters\n",
    "- Prepare data for pattern discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Analyze Query Clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify common themes in user questions\n",
    "- Measure topic importance by volume\n",
    "- Find patterns in user frustration\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Act on Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Target high-impact improvements\n",
    "- Monitor topic changes over time\n",
    "- Validate topic quality\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a good understanding of how to use the `BERTopic` library to generate topics, manually inspect some of these topics and then use them to improve your RAG system. It's important to stress here that topic modelling is just a way to come up with these explicit categories. You should always validate these topics with a domain expert to ensure we're covering all the grounds that we need to.\n"

    "## Generating Topics with BERTopic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Bertopic because it provides a few benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has a modular architecture that allows us to swap out embedding models, clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques easily \n",
    "- It has built in visualisation and analysis tools\n",
    "- It offers a large amount of extensions that we can use to guide the model to generate topics that we care about\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll walk you through how to generate topics from our dataset. In order to ensure our analysis is reproducible, we'll be fixing the random state of the `UMAP` algorithm as seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Our Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "When generating topics, due to the random nature of its dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms, you might get different results than what we have below. Operating systems also add further variation because of the differences in how specific calculations and randomness might be implemented among other factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get around this issue, we'll export a `.csv` a few cells down. We'll save the following data to a single csv file so we can load it for data analysis. Each row will have \n",
    "\n",
    "- `query` : This is the user query that we've generated previously\n",
    "- `topic` : This is the topic id that the query has been assigned to\n",
    "- `answer` : This was the generated answer that we created\n",
    "- `category` : This was the category of the question\n",
    "- `subcategory` : This was the specific subcategory\n",
    "- `satisfaction` : This is a binary value which represents whether users indicated that their query was answered or not which we'll simulate down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that when we start thinking about the categories for our classifier down the line, the analysis that we're performing is reproducible on your local machine so you can get a sense for what the data analysis for topics might look like. We've tried to limit the amount of possible variation by fixing the parameters for UMAP and HDBScan as seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why topic modelling should be used as a way to discover explicit categories of user queries we're doing badly for rather than as an absolute ground truth label."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've looked at a potential workflow for understanding query patterns in your RAG application. First, we generated high-quality synthetic queries by carefully varying personas, intents, and question types. Then using BERTopic, we discovered meaningful clusters of related questions - revealing that payment-related queries were particularly problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead, we'll transform these insights into actionable improvements by building a classifier that can tag and categorize queries in real-time. We'll also demonstrate how we can collaborate with domain experts easily by using a simple .yaml file which allows us to easily define new categories and reuse them in our prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "This topic modeling approach will be particularly valuable when we cover tool calling in Week 6 and metadata parsing in Week 5, allowing us to build systems that can effectively route and handle different types of user queries. By combining topic modeling with these new techniques, we'll be able to build more specialized tooling that can effectively handle different types of user queries and improve our system systematically over time."
