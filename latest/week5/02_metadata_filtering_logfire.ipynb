    "> **Prerequisites**: Please make sure that you've ran `1. Generate Dataset.ipynb` to generate the dataset that we'll be using in this notebook. It'll also help you to get familiar with data that we're working with for this specific case study\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore some of the limitations of semantic search and how we can use metadata filtering to improve the retrieval of complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why this matters\n",
    "\n",
    "As user queries become more complex, it becomes increasingly important to extract specific criteria that user queries need. To do so, we need to use query understanding to extract and map user queries to specific filters we support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the simple example of - I want a medium-sized black cotton T-shirt under $50. This requires multiple criterias to be extracted - size, material and price. In order to be able to do so, we need to have the indexes and data that support these filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Through hands-on experiments with our e-commerce dataset, you'll discover how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the limitations of semantic search\n",
    "- See why semantic search alone falls short for complex queries\n",
    "- Understand the impact of missing structured metadata\n",
    "- Measure baseline performance using recall and MRR metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extend existing metadata fields using LLMs\n",
    "- Extend your product catalog with new metadata fields systematically\n",
    "- Validate that newly generated attributes conform to your existing taxonomy\n",
    "- Scale metadata generation across your entire catalog while maintaining consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement Query Understanding\n",
    "- Extract structured filters from natural language queries\n",
    "- Map arbitrary user requirements to your predefined taxonomy\n",
    "- Implement a retrieval pipeline that combines semantic search with metadata filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a good understanding of how to use language models to implement query understanding for more accurate and useful recomendations with semantic search. More specifically, you'll know how to measure and quantify the improve in performance with these additional filters for more accurate and useful recommendations."

    "\n",
    "We can see that the structured metadata extraction approach shows strong performance on both MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) and Recall metrics. More concretely, we see that recall@5,10,15 shows an improvement of ~30% on average while mrr@5,10,15 shows an improvement of ~77% on average.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "This substantial improvement occurs because metadata filtering effectively narrows the search space to only relevant items based on structured attributes like price, material, and product type. For example, with filters, our recall@10 reaches 0.95, which exceeds the recall@25 (0.84) of the baseline semantic search without filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means we can retrieve more relevant items with fewer results when using structured metadata, leading to a more efficient and accurate retrieval system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates that structured metadata extraction is an effective approach for product search and filtering. In the next portion, we'll look at how we can improve on retrieval performance by improving the captioning of our images.\n"

Previously what we did was to simply embed the description of the text itself but we can do better by concatenating and adding in metadata such as price, category, subcategory and occasions before embedding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this impacts our retrieval performance. We'll do so in 2 steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we'll re-ingest our data so that we use our new formatted text\n",
    "2. Secondly, we'll then benchmark our retrieval against the original description that we embedded\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we looked at how combining semantic search with metadata filtering improves retrieval performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our specific case, we achieved ~78% average improvement in mrr and ~32% improvement in recall across different values of k with query understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "By enhancing item descriptions with structured metadata and mapping user queries to the same taxonomy through query understanding, we were able to build on the evaluation frameworks that we established in Week 1 to quantiatively measure the improvements. By identifying query patterns (Week 4) and adding relevant metadata filters, we ensure our system can handle real-world queries that require both relevance and specific criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, better retrieval requires both improved search and relevant indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll look at how we can take this even further by implementing  text-to-sql capabilities, allowing our system to answer complex questions about product availability and user preferences. This sets us up for Week 6, where we'll explore how to reliably handle tool calling by looking at how to measure the performance of our function calling."
