I should look for information about both entities and highlight similarities and differences...]\n    Answer: [Example Answer 2]\n\n    Now please answer the following question:\n    Question: [Actual User Query]\n    ```\n\nThis organized approach helps you maintain and evolve your example library as your application grows. You can track which examples work best for different situations, rotate examples to prevent overfitting, and continuously refine based on user interactions.\n\n## Practical Implementation: Building the Data Flywheel for Fine-Tuning\n\nWhile few-shot learning is powerful, fine-tuning your embedding models can create even more dramatic improvements in retrieval quality. The challenge is getting enough high-quality data to make fine-tuning worthwhile. This is where the concept of the data flywheel becomes crucial.\n\n### Starting the Flywheel\n\nI often tell teams that building a RAG application is like practicing martial arts\u2014there's a \"wax on, wax off\" aspect to it. You start with a small set of examples that serve as your evaluation benchmarks. As you collect more data, those examples become few-shot prompts. And as your dataset grows further, it becomes training data for fine-tuning.\n\n!!! info \"Data Collection Milestones\" - With 20 examples, you can build basic evaluation benchmarks - With 30 examples, you can create effective few-shot prompts - With 1000+ examples, you can fine-tune your retrieval models\n\nThe beauty of this approach is that you're continuously repurposing the same data for increasingly sophisticated improvements. Each stage builds on the previous one, creating a virtuous cycle of enhancement.\n\n!!! warning \"Start Collecting Now\"\nYou need to start collecting the right data now, even if you're not ready to fine-tune yet. The sooner you start logging relevant user interactions, the sooner you'll reach the critical mass needed for fine-tuning.\n\n### What Data Should You Log?\n\nFor RAG applications, the most valuable data points to collect include:\n\n1. The actual queries users make\n2. Which retrieved chunks were cited in the final responses\n3. Which responses received positive feedback (and which didn't)\n4. Which queries required refinement or follow-up\n\nThese signals help you understand which documents are truly relevant to which queries\u2014the fundamental relationship you're trying to capture in fine-tuned embeddings.\n\n!!! example \"Domain-Specific Relevance Signals\"\nFor other applications, the relevance signals will differ:\n\n    - In e-commerce: track which items are purchased together, viewed in sequence, or added to the same lists\n    - For music recommendations: log which songs appear in the same playlists or are hearted by the same users\n    - For dating apps: record which profiles match and go on to have meaningful conversations\n\nThe key is defining what \"relevance\" means in your specific context and systematically collecting data that captures this relationship.\n\n!!! warning \"Start Logging Yesterday!\"\nI've seen numerous companies hire machine learning engineers to fine-tune embedding models, only to realize they hadn't started logging relevance data. These teams then have to wait 3-6 months to collect enough data before they can begin the work they intended to do immediately.\n\n**The most important action you can take today is to start logging relevance data**, even if you're not ready to hire ML specialists or begin fine-tuning. Save the top 20-40 chunks for each query and use an LLM to mark relevance if human annotation isn't feasible. This data will be invaluable when you're ready to improve your models.\n\nI worked with one team that built a beautiful RAG application for internal documents but failed to implement any feedback collection mechanisms. Six months later, when they wanted to fine-tune their embeddings, they had to start from scratch with synthetic data because they had no record of which retrieved documents had actually been helpful to users. Don't make this mistake\u2014plan your data collection from day one.\n\n!!! success \"Small Datasets Can Make Big Differences\"\nThe team at Sentence Transformers has demonstrated that even with just 6,000 examples, you can achieve 6-10% better performance. With 40 minutes of fine-tuning on a laptop, you can create significant lifetime value for your application. This makes fine-tuning embedding models accessible even to teams without massive datasets or specialized infrastructure.\n\n## Understanding Contrastive Learning for Embeddings\n\nTo understand how fine-tuning works for embedding models, we need to explore contrastive learning\u2014the technique that powers most modern embedding fine-tuning approaches.\n\n### Learning Through Contrasts\n\nContrastive learning is based on a simple but powerful idea: learning what things are similar by understanding what things are different. Rather than trying to predict absolute values, contrastive learning focuses on relative relationships.\n\n!!! info \"Triplet Structure\"\nThe most common implementation uses a structure called a triplet, which consists of:\n\n    1. An **anchor** (usually the query)\n    2. A **positive example** (a document that's relevant to the query)\n    3. A **negative example** (a document that's not relevant to the query)\n\nThe goal of training is straightforward: adjust the embedding model so that the distance between the anchor and positive example decreases, while the distance between the anchor and negative example increases. In other words, pull similar things closer together and push dissimilar things further apart.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Anchor: Query] --- P[Positive: Relevant Document]\n    A --- N[Negative: Irrelevant Document]\n    P -.- |\"Pull Closer\"| A\n    N -.- |\"Push Away\"| A\n</code></pre> <p>This approach is particularly effective for embedding models because it directly optimizes for the distance relationships we care about in retrieval tasks.</p>","tags":["few-shot","fine-tuning","training-data","evaluation"]},{"location":"workshops/chapter2/#creating-effective-triplets-for-rag","title":"Creating Effective Triplets for RAG","text":"<p>For RAG applications, there are several natural ways to create triplet datasets:</p> <ul> <li>Anchor: The user's query</li> <li>Positive: Document chunks that were cited in the final response or received positive feedback</li> <li>Negative: Document chunks that were retrieved but not cited, or received negative feedback</li> </ul> <p>Healthcare RAG Triplet</p> <p>Imagine a healthcare RAG application where a user asks:</p> <pre><code>```\nWhat are the side effects of medication X?\n```\n\nOur retrieval system might return several documents, including:\n\n```\nDocument A: \"Medication X may cause drowsiness, nausea, and in rare cases, allergic reactions.\"\n\nDocument B: \"Medication X is used to treat high blood pressure and should be taken with food.\"\n```\n\nIf Document A is cited in the response while Document B isn't, we can create a triplet:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"anchor\": \"What are the side effects of medication X?\",\n  \"positive\": \"Medication X may cause drowsiness, nausea, and in rare cases, allergic reactions.\",\n  \"negative\": \"Medication X is used to treat high blood pressure and should be taken with food.\"\n}\n```\n</code></pre> <p>Through many such examples, the model learns that queries about side effects should be closer to texts describing adverse reactions than to texts describing indications or administration instructions.</p>","tags":["few-shot","fine-tuning","training-data","evaluation"]},{"location":"workshops/chapter2/#the-challenge-of-hard-negatives-and-how-ux-can-help","title":"The Challenge of Hard Negatives and How UX Can Help","text":"<p>The triplet example above introduces an important subtlety in contrastive learning.

Hard negative mining is the process of finding negative examples that are challenging but instructive for the model.</p> <p>Designing UX for Better Training Data</p> <p>If you're serious about improving your embeddings, consider explicitly designing your UX to capture these signals:</p> <pre><code>1. **Document-level feedback mechanisms**: Add simple thumbs up/down options next to each retrieved document, not just for the final answer\n\n2. **Click tracking**: Record which documents users click on and which they ignore\u2014those ignored despite ranking highly are excellent hard negative candidates\n\n3. **Dwell time analysis**: If a user quickly returns from a document without spending time reading it, that's a strong signal it wasn't relevant\n\n4. **Explicit comparison interfaces**: For critical applications, consider interfaces that ask users to compare documents and select the most relevant one\n\n5. **Query reformulation tracking**: When a user modifies their query slightly and gets better results, you can pair the original query with documents from the improved results to create training pairs\n</code></pre> <p>One particularly effective approach I've seen involved a \"more like this\" button next to helpful documents.

By having the model monologue - explicitly reiterate key information before answering - we reorganize the context in a way that allows the model to effectively \"re-read\" the prompt, improving reasoning dramatically without complex architectural changes.</p> <p>The process is wonderfully simple: ask the model to \"think out loud\" about what information is relevant before generating the final answer. This serves several purposes:</p> <ol> <li>It helps the model re-read and reinforce important context</li> <li>It allows the model to organize scattered information into a coherent structure</li> <li>It creates natural separation between reasoning and response</li> <li>It produces valuable data for future fine-tuning</li> <li>It can replace more complex multi-stage agents for many use cases</li> <li>It can improve consistency by ensuring the model considers all relevant factors</li> </ol> <p>Monologues have proven particularly effective at replacing complex agent architectures for many use cases. Rather than building intricate multi-stage processes, you can often achieve similar results with a single thoughtfully constructed monologue prompt, saving both development time and computational resources.</p> <p>Here's an example prompt for implementing monologues:</p> <pre><code>def monologue_prompt(query: str, documents: list, pricing_data: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a prompt that encourages monologuing for improved comprehension.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - query: The user's question about pricing options\n    - documents: Relevant call transcripts or customer information\n    - pricing_data: Pricing documentation and guidelines\n\n    Returns:\n    - A prompt that will generate a structured monologue before answering\n    \"\"\"\n    context = \"\\n\\n\".join([f\"TRANSCRIPT: {doc.content}\" for doc in documents])\n\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    You'll help generate a pricing quote based on the call transcript and pricing documentation.\n\n    First, reiterate the key variables that determine pricing options according to the documentation.\n    Then, identify specific parts of the transcript that relate to these variables.\n    Next, determine which pricing options from the documentation are most relevant.\n    Finally, provide a recommended pricing quote with justification.\n\n    QUESTION: {query}\n\n    TRANSCRIPT:\n    {context}\n\n    PRICING DOCUMENTATION:\n    {pricing_data}\n\n    MONOLOGUE AND ANSWER:\n    \"\"\"\n\n    return prompt\n</code></pre> <p>I want to share a specific case study that demonstrates the power of monologues. We were working with a SaaS company that needed to generate pricing quotes based on sales call transcripts and a complex pricing document. The initial approach\u2014simply providing the transcript and pricing document as context\u2014resulted in quotes that were often inconsistent or missed key information from the transcript.</p> <p>Monologue Implementation</p> <p>Rather than building a complex multi-stage agent, we found it was much more effective to simply cache-prompt the pricing data and inject a single call transcript with specific monologue instructions.</p> <p>We implemented a monologue-based approach that instructed the model to:</p> <ol> <li>First reiterate the variables that determine pricing options</li> <li>Then identify relevant parts of the transcript that mention these variables</li> <li>Next determine which pricing tiers and options apply</li> <li>Finally generate the actual quote with justification</li> </ol> <p>The results were remarkable\u2014quote accuracy improved from 62% to 94%, and sales representatives reported much greater confidence in the system's recommendations. The monologue approach helped the model connect scattered information from the transcript with the precise rules in the pricing document, creating much more coherent reasoning.</p> <p>Business Impact</p> <p>After implementing this approach, 90% of the follow-up emails were accepted by sales reps without any edits. This generated a wealth of training data that we used to fine-tune a smaller, more efficient model. Eventually, the fine-tuned model achieved similar accuracy without needing the explicit monologue step, demonstrating how monologues can be used as a stepping stone to more efficient solutions.</p> <p>Monologue in Action</p> <p>Query: What pricing should we offer based on this call transcript?</p> <pre><code>**Monologue:**\nLet me identify the key pricing variables from our documentation:\n1. Number of users (determines tier)\n2. Required features (basic, professional, enterprise)\n3. Length of contract commitment (monthly vs. annual)\n4. Add-on options (API access, premium support)\n\nFrom the transcript, I can see:\n- The customer mentioned needing \"around 50 user seats\" (line 127)\n- They specifically asked about the \"workflow automation feature\" (line 213)\n- They stated \"we're looking for an annual commitment\" (line 289)\n- They expressed interest in \"API access for integration\" (line 342)\n\nAccording to our pricing documentation:\n- 50 users falls into the Medium Business tier ($30/user/month)\n- Workflow automation is part of the Professional plan\n- Annual commitment provides a 20% discount\n- API access is a $500/month add-on\n\n**Answer:**\nBased on the call transcript, I recommend offering the Professional plan with API access add-on:\n- 50 users \u00d7 $30/user/month = $1,500/month\n- API access add-on: $500/month\n- Subtotal: $2,000/month\n- Annual commitment (20% discount): $19,200/year\n\nThis aligns with their needs for workflow automation and API access while providing the annual discount they're expecting.\n</code></pre> <p>This example shows how monologues can dramatically improve comprehension and reasoning, especially for complex tasks with multiple documents. The approach doesn't require any special architecture\u2014just thoughtful prompting that encourages the model to organize information before generating a response.</p> <p>Monologues can also improve tonality and quality by separating reasoning from response generation. Have the model first reason about what to say, then say it in the desired tone. This creates datasets for future fine-tuning without reasoning steps, allowing you to eventually distill the reasoning process into more efficient models.</p>","tags":["citations","chain-of-thought","validation","prompting"]},{"location":"workshops/chapter3-3/#validation-patterns-the-safety-net-approach","title":"Validation Patterns: The Safety Net Approach","text":"","tags":["citations","chain-of-thought","validation","prompting"]},{"location":"workshops/chapter3-3/#catching-errors-before-they-reach-users","title":"Catching Errors Before They Reach Users","text":"<p>In the early days of RAG systems, there was a tendency to treat the language model's response as the final word\u2014whatever it generated went straight to the user, for better or worse.

After collecting sufficient examples of corrections, we fine-tuned our model (distilling GPT-4 into a smaller model) using this dataset of corrected responses. The result was astonishing - the base error rate before validation dropped to nearly zero. The model had effectively learned from its corrections, internalizing the patterns of valid URLs and avoiding problematic ones altogether.</p> <p>This entire validation and fine-tuning process took just three days to implement and resulted in a much faster application since we no longer needed the retry loop. The model now produces valid URLs in a single pass.</p> <p>This example illustrates a broader principle: validation doesn't just catch errors\u2014it creates valuable training data that can improve your system over time. Each correction becomes a learning opportunity, gradually reducing the need for the validator itself.</p> <p>Persistent Challenges</p> <p>It's worth noting that even in early 2025, even the most advanced models can still produce hallucinated URLs when given the opportunity.
